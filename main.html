      <p>
        <strong>Inception</strong> follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in extracting secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. He is offered a chance to erase his criminal history if he can do the impossible — perform inception: planting an idea into someone’s mind. The film dives into multiple dream layers, where time, physics, and reality are unpredictable.
